brainstorming

	there are 3 ways to go about this 

	should they pick the entire thing? 
		probably not, because it's not about figuring something sooner as opposed to later
		plus, it's not like the action can be an array of any size 

	dynamic preferences vs non-dynamics preferences? 

	how long is this article anyway? 
	
notes

	aggregate
		state = the user-content laplacian 
		actions = user + content

	content
		state = user-content laplacian + content-features laplacian
		actions = user + content

	mean field 
		both conditions but with a fractional reward 
		concerned whether the results just won't stabilize
